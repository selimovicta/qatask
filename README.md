Quality Assurance task 

To access the automated tests you will need to download jdk-18_windows-x64_bin.exe Java
I used Eclipse for viewing and running tests so download eclipse-inst-jre-win64.exe Eclipse
I also downloaded the Selenium jar side of the automation selenium-server-4.1.3.jar Selenium
Last thing was the Chrome driver where the tests are conducted chromedriver_win32.zip Chromewdriver

System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "C:\\Users\\PC\\Desktop\\chromedriver_win32\\chromedriver.exe"); Location of webdriver// Should be changed to your PC location directory.

After dowlnlading the code directory, you should be able to run the code with no issues- Run Java Application
